 * Aquarium is a graphical "application" that uses some code I built and have

 * the user in a simple way.
 * 
 * The method draw is called 50 times per second, so we make an animation by
 * drawing our fish in one place, and moving that place slightly. The next time
 * draw gets called, our fish looks like it moved!
